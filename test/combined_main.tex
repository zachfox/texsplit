\begin{abstract}
Emerging biological techniques now allow for precise quantification of distributions of biological molecules in single cells.
These rapidly advancing experimental methods have created a need for more rigorous and efficient modeling tools.
Here, we derive new bounds on the likelihood that observations of single-cell, single-molecule responses come from a given discrete stochastic model.  
These strict upper and lower bounds are based upon a Finite State Projection (FSP) approach, and they converge monotonically to the exact likelihood value.  These bounds allow one to discriminate rigorously between models and with a minimum level of computational effort.  In practice, these bounds can be incorporated into stochastic model identification routines and improve the accuracy and efficiency of endeavors to analyze and predict single-cell behavior.
